# This is a program to create folders for grouping files with
# similar names together. For example create a folder 038_FJB_1904-001
# to group the files 038_FJB_1904-001a.tif and 038_FJB_1904-001b.tif
# Rule to determine similarity of names is specified within the function
# compareRule
#
# After folders were generated files are moved into them.

#
# Specify the path with first variable
